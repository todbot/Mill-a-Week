# Hand Coding Gerbers
Where carlyn gets a wee bit controlling. 

## Why did Carlyn want to hand code gerber files?

Because she's crazy.

## No, really...

Well I was interested in the difference between how otherplan imported .svg files 
and eagle .brd files. Specifically with svg files I didn't feel like I had enough 
control over "put a hole here." 

Eagle, however, isn't a design package. 

I wanted some lower level control so I could someday create algorithmically 
generated designs. 

This very much not be the best path to go down for this. But it was entertaining. 

## Whats a gerber file?

Gerber files are the set up files for PCB board houses so they can deliver do precisely 
what you want with super tiny tolerances.

A given project might have lots of files for different aspects of the board.
  
### How did you learn how to write them?

Well, I already know Eagle and UML and exporting to gerber, blah blah blah so I wasn't
starting from zero.
