### LED-OtherCat - 29 May 2015

### HandCodedGerberPart01 - 5 Jun 2015
- Task: Explore how Otherplan imports Gerbers vs. SVGs, since in SVGs you can't do "put a hole here"
- Notes:
  - See [HandCodedGerberPart01/README.md](HandCodedGerberPart01/README.md)

### NeoJoints - 5 Jun 2015
- Task: Make "joints" for NeoPixel/WS2812 LED strip to make it easier to join pieces together
- Notes:
  - Programmatically generating these for different angles, LED spacing, etc. would be good.
