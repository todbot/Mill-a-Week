# Mill-a-Week
weekly experiments with othermachine Othermill by @todbot & @carlynorama


## Projects

### MyFirstOtherMillPendant - 22 May 2015
- Task: Use Illustrator to make a non-circuit design
- Notes:
  - Hard to align multiple SVGs

### LED-OtherCat - 29 May 2015
- Task: Make simple non-rectangular circuit in Eagle using 1/16" endmill
- Notes:
  - Can't do most through-hole with 1/16" --> Do extra hole pass at 1/32"

### HandCodedGerberPart01 - 5 Jun 2015
- Task: Explore how Otherplan imports Gerbers vs. SVGs, since in SVGs you can't do "put a hole here"
- Notes:
  - See [HandCodedGerberPart01/README.md](HandCodedGerberPart01/README.md)

### NeoJoints - 5 Jun 2015
- Task: Make "joints" for NeoPixel/WS2812 LED strip to make it easier to join pieces together
- Notes:
  - Programmatically generating these for different angles, LED spacing, etc. would be good.

### MillBug - 5 Jun 2015
- Task: Make an ATtiny85-based circuit using something other than LEDs
- Notes:
 - Soldering SMD on non-soldermask boards is a recipe for disaster if you have spazzy hands.
